# ucanet Registry Updater

This Python script provides a simple command-line interface to manage and update the `ucanet-registry.txt` file used by the ucanet system. The script is modular, making it easy to extend with additional features in the future.

## ðŸ”§ Current Functionality

### Option 1: Update ucanet Registry from Version 1.0 to 1.1

Reads the file:
ucanet-registry.txt

Each line in this file is expected to have the following structure:

[ucanet domain name] [ucanet owner id] [internet IP address/or behavior identfying name]

**Update Rules**:
- If the third field (`<address>`) is a valid IP address (e.g. `192.168.1.1`) or the word `protoweb`, it remains unchanged.
- If the third field is anything else (e.g. `downloadfilesfree33`), it will have `.neocities.org` appended to it (e.g. `downloadfilesfree33.neocities.org`).

**Files Written**:
- A backup of the original file is saved as:  
  `../ucanet-registry/ucanet-registry-v1.0-as-at{date stamp}.txt`
- The updated file is saved as:  
  `../ucanet-registry/ucanet-registry.txt`

### Option 2: Adds useful domains to the collective
This option will append the contents of addons.txt to the v1.1 registry. It contains sites that may be of interest to retrocomputing. The structure is [ucanet domain name] 0 [realworld domain name] using the real world name will mean less maintenance as ucanet now has the ability to pass through to the real world domain, without needing to constantly update the ip address in the registry. The 0 between the domain names means they are not owned by anyone. There are some domains in the list that are owned by people already, those will be turned over to the collective. It shouldn't be controversial as there is no longer a need for the owner to perform maintenance on the domain. If you disagree, you can always remove the offending domain from addons.txt. 

### Option 0: Exit  
Closes the application.
